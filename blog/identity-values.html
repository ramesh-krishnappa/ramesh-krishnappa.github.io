<h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
  Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, 
  and the consequences of your action.</h3>
  <li>One of my colleagues was falling asleep while working. He had drinking issues and it was getting worst. 
    I spoke to him couple of times and that didn’t stop him. Finally had to share this with my boss who was 
    living in another town. I know this can cause a big issue, but I have to be honest to my role. 
    My colleague didn’t like what I did, has the time passed he understood.</li>

  <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
  <li>I am from India and we believe in strong family bonding, Sharing and 
    helping each other and have gratitude when someone helps.</li>

  <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
  <li>My strengths are positive attitude determination and will power. Whereas my biggest 
    limitations are communication and writing skills. </li>
    
  <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning 
    journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
  <li>With Positive attitude and will power I can overcome my limitations. </li>

  <h3>	Share an example from your experience of where you were trying 
    to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
    Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, 
    and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
  <li>When I started my last job, there was a technician who had issues working with me. 
    Every time we were working on a task, I could feel resistance from my colleague who didn’t want to 
    take instructions from me. Took him for coffee and explained him that I was only doing my job 
    and I have a family to look after. After that day the resistance was gone, and we worked very well has a 
    team. I don’t think I will do anything different now. 
    I think sharing your thoughts openly can fix lot of issues.</li>
