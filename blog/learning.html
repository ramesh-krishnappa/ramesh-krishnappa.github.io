  <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
  <li> My long-term goal is to become a successful web developer/programmer which should enable 
    me to work remotely from any part of the world. Really want to achieve this to gain so I 
    can spend more time with my family.</li>

    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <li>Determination and curiosity are my strengths. Learning new things always excites me. 
      I really struggle with writing blogs or to explain, need to work on this.</li>

    
    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) 
      would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <li>Would like to develop my communication skills and also learn more 
      to socialise with other fellow students.</li>
    
    <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself 
      to work productively and safely with other learners, 
      Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
    <li>Building good relationship with the team members and facilitators is very important. 
      Respect fellow team members opinions and trying to understand the point of view is necessary. </li>
    <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
    <li>I think best option is to take a break. Have a cup of coffee and take deep breathe to relax and cool down
       your brain. Once the emotions are under control check with the team members if anyone can help. 
       Asking for help is better than struggling.</li>
    <h3>5.	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <li>If I am struck with the task even after trying my best, I will approach my fellow learners for help. 
      Even if that doesn’t help with escalate to the facilitators. 
      In the meantime I will move to the next task. </li>
    <h3>6.	A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <li>I am just expecting the facilitators to be supportive. I am new 
      to programming and good to know that we have a great team of facilitators who can
       help us when we need them.</li>
       <h3>7.	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
         For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
       <li>Keen to take some breaks during the day. If My whanau needs me, then I will be taking short breaks, 
        but assure you the tasks will be completed on time.</li>
