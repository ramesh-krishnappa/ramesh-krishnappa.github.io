<h3>A time I was blocked by a simple problem:</h3>
<p>Javascript is challenging, maybe because I am learning it for the first time. I was struck several times during the JavaScript Kata challenge.
  I tried breaking it down into smaller parts and kept trying. While doing Built-in Methods, I was struck with concatMyArray functions for a few hours, I finally reached out for help on discord, and a fellow student helped me solve this. I was a bit confused and frustrated throughout the process. But this is common when learning something new. In the end, I completed the challenge and am happy now.

<h3>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
<p class="p"><img src="../Images/Thinking.jpg" alt="Thinking If i solved elegantly "></p>
<p>I can't think of a time when I could elegantly solve the problem. Every task involved a lot of help from Mr Google. I think that's how we all learn. I am happy that I managed to complete the tasks and looking forward to the next sprint. </p>

<h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
<p class="p"><img src="../Images/working on it.gif" alt="Working on it "></p>
<p>I want to represent my confidence on a scale of 1 to 5 Stars. One &#9733 being no confidence and five &#9733 being very confident. </p>
