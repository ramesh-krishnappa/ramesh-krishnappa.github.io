<h3>A time I was blocked by a simple problem:</h3>
<p>Javascript is challenging, maybe because I am learning it for the first time. I was struck several times during the JavaScript Kata challenge.
  I tried breaking it down into smaller parts and kept trying. While doing Built-in Methods, I was struck with concatMyArray functions for a few hours, I finally reached out for help on discord, and a fellow student helped me solve this. I was a bit confused and frustrated throughout the process. But this is common when learning something new. In the end, I completed the challenge and am happy now.
