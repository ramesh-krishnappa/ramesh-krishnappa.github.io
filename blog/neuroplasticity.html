<h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>

<h2>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h2>
<p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity helps us to implement it in our lives. When we keep our brains busy, it stays healthy. Repeatedly practise an activity or access a memory, their neural networks -- groups of neurons that fire together, creating electrochemical pathways -- shape themselves according to that activity or memory.</p>
<h2>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h2>
<p>Learning a new language, playing an instrument, or getting more physically active will help with stress and well-being. Do new things, practice as it creates new pathways and helps your brain to become more neuroplastic.</p>
<h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
<p>I can start listening to music, going for more walks or swimming. These activities will help in increasing my neuroplasticity growth</p>
<h3>Growth Mindset</h3>

<h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
<p>A growth mindset means that you thrive on challenges and donâ€™t see failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities. Your intelligence and talents are all susceptible to development.</p>
<h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
<p>I am always a positive thinking person, and I was surprised when I read about the growth mindset. I was already practising it.  </p>
<h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
<p>Understanding and acknowledging the failures and setting plans to overcome the losses. We need to value The process of learning over the end result.</p>

<h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
<p>Learning is non ending process. The day we stop learning new things thats when we start moving towards the dark. Moving forward along with my busy life, I will make sure to learn something new all the time, spend time with family and also prioritize my health and life style.</p>
