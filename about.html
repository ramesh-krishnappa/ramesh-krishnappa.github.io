      <p class="p"> Kia ora! I am Ramesh. I was born and bought up in Bangalore, India. 
        I moved to New Zealand in 2012, and Gisborne is my home town now. 
        I am living with a 4-year-old son and a beautiful wife.</p>
    
      <p class="p"> I have always been passionate about computers and technology. 
        So choose IT has my carrier. I am working as a Systems engineer with 10+year's experience. </p>
    
      <p class="p"> I love going for walks and bike riding along with my son on the lovely beach walkways in Gisborne. </p>
